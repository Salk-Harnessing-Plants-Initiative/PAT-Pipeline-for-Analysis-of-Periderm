Welcome to the PAT 1.0 repository. This README and the repository code are continuously being updated as we prepare for publication. Please check back regularly for new features and documentation!

## Installing PAT 1.0

To get started with PAT 1.0, first download the code. You can do this either as a zip file from this page or by cloning the git repository (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Salk-Harnessing-Plants-Initiative/PAT-Pipeline-for-Analysis-of-Periderm.git
```
After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies. For Linux users, use the following commands:
```bash
cd PAT-Pipeline-for-Analysis-of-Periderm
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
For users on other operating systems, we recommend using Anaconda due to the complexity of library support. Install Anaconda and then create a new environment using the provided yml dependencies file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate PAT-Pipeline-for-Analysis-of-Periderm
```
This will download and set up all the necessary libraries, including a Python 3.8 installation.
